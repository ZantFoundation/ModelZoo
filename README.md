# Zant Model Zoo

Here you can find a collection of NN model supported by Zant Inference Engine. To be clear, those are not the only models supported.

## How to use them in [Zant Inference Engine](https://github.com/ZantFoundation/Z-Ant)
Zant ask you to put `your_model.onnx` inside dataset/models/your_model/your_model.onnx.  
So just download the folder of your interest and upload it into dataset/models inside your local Zant Repo.
